# Haskell CAS (Computer Algebra System)

This project creates a CAS in Haskell to be used by other Haskell modules or equally well in the Haskell Interpreter.

It comes with a handy Makefile which automates many of the common tasks associated with the project (compilation, testing, etc.).

## Testing

This project uses *HUnit* for unit-testing. To run the unit tests simply execute ``make test``.
